TD Stats day?

Release a new dashboard/stat on every Tuesday during the season

One table will be all the innings by batsmen
bowling figures by innings
extras on batting card
extras on bowling card
partnerships

Currently we'll only look at our own players, might need a rethink when looking at every match


Is this player a keeper or captain? Done
Which club was this innings for? Done

Ground name not quite working - Done

Need better date formatting
Some matches over multiple days take first? Done

What if we only scrape to get soup?
Should speed the whole thing up hopefully

Html stored in a json - can load into dict, update, then dump back to json
load, get keys, scrape latest year and add any match urls/html not already in there

We're missing some runs and matches, need to figure out if this is a formatting issue or if the html didn't load in
Found em, was abandoned matches, forgot to add provision for that

Want to get down to a single run for adding new matches, should go like this:
- get new matches creates a new html dict and updates the old one for storage
- pass this to soup dict function
- then pass to get match data and get the dataframes
- append these to the csv for that given year
- recreate the combined view from the separate csvs
